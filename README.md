#1 - Booking link extractor (read me)


"Hello everyone, Sorry this took a while to automate  it was quite complex. The instructions are in the README file . All you need to do is create an Excel file with the columns named according to the instructions, then run the script. It will automatically extract the booking links.I recommend running it in batches of 20‚Äì50 and spot-checking for accuracy. This is just a tool to speed up the process, but I still advise manually verifying the results. Based on my calculations, the accuracy is around 90%. I‚Äôll work on automating the rest of the allied health professionals next and will update you soon."

## üéØ Basic Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Practitioner with Website

Create a file called `test_single.py`:

```python
from comprehensive_booking_extractor import ComprehensiveBookingExtractor

# Initialize extractor
extractor = ComprehensiveBookingExtractor()

# Extract data
result = extractor.extract_practitioner_data(
    practitioner_name="Dr. John Smith",
    clinic_website="https://example-clinic.com"
)

# Print results
print("Results:")
for key, value in result.items():
    print(f"  {key}: {value}")
```

Run it:
```bash
python3 test_single.py
```

### Example 2: Batch Processing

Create a file called `test_batch.py`:

```python
from comprehensive_booking_extractor import process_practitioners_batch
import pandas as pd

# Your practitioners data
practitioners_data = [
    {'name': 'Justin Chipperfield', 'clinic_website': 'https://www.chipperfieldphysio.ca/team'},
    {'name': 'Cathy Crawley', 'clinic_website': 'https://www.portcoquitlamphysio.com/'},
    {'name': 'Kirk Boechler', 'clinic_website': 'https://physicalpursuit.ca/'},
]

# Process practitioners
results = process_practitioners_batch(practitioners_data)

# Save to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(results)
df.to_csv('my_results.csv', index=False)

print(f"‚úÖ Processed {len(results)} practitioners")
print("üìÅ Results saved to: my_results.csv")
```

Run it:
```bash
python3 test_batch.py
```

### Example 3: Process from CSV File

If you have a CSV file with practitioner data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from comprehensive_booking_extractor import process_practitioners_batch

# Load your CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('your_practitioners.csv')

# Convert to required format
practitioners_data = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    practitioners_data.append({
        'name': row['practitioner_name'],  # Adjust column name as needed
        'clinic_website': row.get('clinic_website', '')  # Adjust column name as needed
    })

# Process
results = process_practitioners_batch(practitioners_data)

# Save enhanced results
enhanced_df = pd.DataFrame(results)
enhanced_df.to_csv('enhanced_results.csv', index=False)

print("‚úÖ Processing complete!")
```

## üåê Google APIs Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For practitioners without clinic websites, the script can use Google APIs as a fallback.

### Step 1: Get Google API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the **Places API**
4. Create credentials ‚Üí API Key
5. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Set Up API Key

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
# Mac/Linux
export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'

# Windows
set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Option B: Direct in Code**
```python
from comprehensive_booking_extractor import ComprehensiveBookingExtractor

extractor = ComprehensiveBookingExtractor(google_api_key='your_api_key_here')
```

### Step 3: Test Google APIs

```python
from comprehensive_booking_extractor import ComprehensiveBookingExtractor

extractor = ComprehensiveBookingExtractor(google_api_key='your_key')

# Test with practitioner without website
result = extractor.extract_practitioner_data(
    practitioner_name="Dr. Smith Physiotherapy Vancouver BC"
    # No clinic_website provided - will use Google APIs
)

print("Google API Result:", result)
```

## üìä Understanding the Output

The script returns data in this format:

```python
{
    'practitioner_name': 'Dr. John Smith',           # Input name
    'clinic_website': 'https://example.com',        # Input or found website
    'booking_url': 'https://clinic.janeapp.com/',   # Found booking URL
    'weekday_earliest_am': '08:00 AM',              # Weekday opening time
    'weekday_latest_pm': '05:00 PM',                # Weekday closing time
    'weekend_earliest_am': '09:00 AM',              # Weekend opening time
    'weekend_latest_pm': '02:00 PM',                # Weekend closing time
    'days_closed': 'Sunday',                        # Days when closed
    'data_source': 'clinic_website'                 # Where data came from
}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Module not found" Error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```
**Solution:**
```bash
pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

#### 2. "Permission denied" Error
**Solution:**
```bash
# Mac/Linux
sudo pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas

# Or use user installation
pip3 install --user requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

#### 3. Python Command Not Found
**Solution:**
- Windows: Use `python` instead of `python3`
- Mac: Install Python 3 from [python.org](https://python.org)
- Linux: `sudo apt install python3`

#### 4. SSL Certificate Errors
**Solution:**
```bash
pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

#### 5. Slow Performance
**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Slow internet**: Script waits for website responses
- **Many practitioners**: Use smaller batches
- **Rate limiting**: Built-in delays prevent server overload

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging to troubleshoot issues:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

from comprehensive_booking_extractor import ComprehensiveBookingExtractor
# Your code here...
```

## üìà Performance Expectations

- **Single practitioner**: 3-5 seconds
- **Batch of 10**: 30-50 seconds  
- **With Google APIs**: +1-2 seconds per practitioner
- **Success rate**: 70-90% for booking URLs, 30-60% for hours

## üîí Best Practices

### 1. Rate Limiting
The script includes built-in delays. Don't remove them to avoid being blocked by websites.

### 2. Error Handling
Always check results for empty values:
```python
if result['booking_url']:
    print(f"‚úÖ Found booking URL: {result['booking_url']}")
else:
    print("‚ùå No booking URL found")
```

### 3. Data Validation
Verify important results manually for critical applications.

### 4. Batch Processing
Process large datasets in smaller batches (10-20 practitioners) to avoid timeouts.

## üìù Sample Data Format

### Input CSV Format
```csv
practitioner_name,clinic_website
Dr. John Smith,https://example-clinic.com
Dr. Jane Doe,https://another-clinic.com
Dr. Mike Johnson,
```

### Output CSV Format
```csv
practitioner_name,clinic_website,booking_url,weekday_earliest_am,weekday_latest_pm,weekend_earliest_am,weekend_latest_pm,days_closed,data_source
Dr. John Smith,https://example-clinic.com,https://clinic.janeapp.com/,08:00 AM,05:00 PM,09:00 AM,02:00 PM,Sunday,clinic_website
```

## üÜò Getting Help

### Check These First:
1. **Python version**: `python3 --version` (should be 3.7+)
2. **Package installation**: `pip3 list | grep requests`
3. **Internet connection**: Can you browse websites normally?
4. **File permissions**: Can you create files in the script directory?

### Common Solutions:
- **Restart terminal** after installing packages
- **Use full file paths** if script can't find files
- **Check firewall settings** if network requests fail
- **Try different Python command**: `python` vs `python3`

## üéâ You're Ready!

Once you've completed the setup:

1. ‚úÖ Python 3 installed and working
2. ‚úÖ Required packages installed
3. ‚úÖ Script files downloaded
4. ‚úÖ Test run completed successfully

You can now process healthcare practitioner data to extract booking URLs and operating hours efficiently!

#2- Kin website extractor (read me)

This document provides a comprehensive guide for using the kinesiologist_website extractor.py script. It includes all necessary information for your team, from setting up the required software to troubleshooting common issues.

BC Kinesiologist Website Extractor
This Python script is a web scraper designed to extract information on kinesiologists from the BC Association of Kinesiologists website. The tool is robust and includes features to handle common scraping challenges.

Key Features
Targeted Scraping: The script can be configured to start and stop at any practitioner number.

Detailed Data Extraction: It extracts practitioner names, genders, practice areas, workplaces, and profile URLs.

Website Discovery: The tool is designed to find clinic websites by searching Google and other sources.

Checkpoint Saving: Progress is automatically saved to a CSV file at regular intervals, allowing you to resume the process if it's interrupted.

Final Output: A final CSV file is generated with all collected data.

Prerequisites
To run this script, you must have Python 3 installed on your computer.

You also need the following Python libraries. Think of these as special tools the script needs to do its job:

requests

beautifulsoup4

googlesearch-python

To install them, open your terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and type the following command, then press Enter:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 googlesearch-python

Usage Instructions
Save the Script: Make sure the kinesiologist_website extractor.py file is saved on your computer.

Install Libraries: Run the pip install command from the "Prerequisites" section if you haven't already.

Run the Script: In your terminal, navigate to where you saved the file and run it with this command:

python kinesiologist_website extractor.py

Troubleshooting & Other Instructions
Changing the Scraping Range: The script is set to start from record 101 and scrape 200 records by default. To change this, open the kinesiologist_website extractor.py file in a text editor and find these two lines in the KinesiologistNext200 class:

self.max_practitioners = 200  # Change this to the total number of people to find.
self.target_start = 100        # Change this to 0 to start from the beginning, or any number to start at a different record.

Change the numbers to whatever you want, then save and run the script again.

Script Interrupted: If you stop the script by pressing Ctrl+C, don't worry. The last saved "checkpoint" file will contain all the progress made up to that point. You can manually restart from the last checkpoint if needed.

ModuleNotFoundError or ImportError: If you see an error that says something like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'", it means you forgot to install one of the required libraries. Go back to the "Prerequisites" section and run the pip install command again.

Rate Limiting Message: If the script prints a message about "rate limiting," this is normal. It means the website or search engine asked the script to slow down, and the script is designed to do this automatically. Just let it continue.
